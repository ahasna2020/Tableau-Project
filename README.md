> # Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals

This project is a study of global death data using the datasets provided by "Our World in Data" using Tableau as the data analytics and visualization tool. The following are the main goals of this project:

-   Turning data into easily consumable visual insights, using Tableau
-   Creating impactful dashboards that help stakeholders make decisions, based on a business questions
-   Communicating insights with the correct visualizations

This analysis aims at answering the following questions:

 1. Which are the countries with most deaths in the world?
 2. What is the forecasted death counts and trend?
 3. Which are the leading causes of death in the countries with top death counts?
 4. Which are the causes that contribute the least to deaths?
 5. What inferences can be drawn from the analysis?
 6. What story does the data tell us?

## Process
In order to answer the above questions, the following are the steps that were followed:

1. Referred to [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivanchvez/causes-of-death-our-world-in-data/data) page on Kaggle to review and download the dataset.
2. Did further exploratory data analysis of the files to determine reliability of data. Performed data cleanup where country information was ambiguous for some parts of the dataset (20222703 Causes Of Death Clean Output V2.0.csv). 
3. Started high level data analysis by plotting visualizations over several Tableau worksheets to study the data and develop inference.
4. Each visualization and inference led to the next visualization and resulting inferences. 
5. As a next step, dashboards were created using the visualizations that were developed.
6. As a final step a Tableau story was created by utilizing the dashboards created with ample explanations on the inferences made.
