> # Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals

This project is a study of global death data using the datasets provided by "Our World in Data" using Tableau as the data analytics and visualization tool. The following are the main goals of this project:

-   Turning data into easily consumable visual insights, using Tableau
-   Creating impactful dashboards that help stakeholders make decisions, based on business questions
-   Communicating insights with the correct visualizations

This analysis aims at answering the following questions:

 1. Which are the countries with most deaths in the world?
 2. What is the forecasted death counts and trend?
 3. What are the leading causes of death in the countries with top death counts?
 4. What are the causes that contribute the least to deaths?
 5. What inferences can be drawn from the analysis?
 6. What story does the data tell us?
 7. Where should governments spend more funds to improve the lifespan of their citizens?

## Process
In order to try and answer the above questions, the following are the steps that were followed:

1. Referred to [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivanchvez/causes-of-death-our-world-in-data/data) page on Kaggle to review and download the dataset.
2. Did further exploratory data analysis of the files to determine reliability of data. Performed data cleanup where country information was ambiguous for some parts of the dataset (20222703 Causes Of Death Clean Output V2.0.csv). The file had United States and America as country information. These were merged to United States after reviewing the data.
3. Started high level data analysis by plotting visualizations over several Tableau worksheets to study the data and develop inference.
4. Each visualization and inference led to the next visualization and resulting inferences. 
5. As a next step, dashboards were created using the visualizations that were developed.
6. As a final step a Tableau story was created by utilizing the dashboards created with ample explanations on the inferences made.

## Results

For this analysis, Option 2 was chosen. The dataset chosen was "Causes of Death - Our World in Data". The dataset is available from the Kaggle website: [Cause of Death - Our World In Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivanchvez/causes-of-death-our-world-in-data?resource=download).

The following sets of visualizations were created to understand the data trends:

1. High level death data analysis by countries to identify the death counts by country.
2. Death count trend over the years and forecast. 
3. Death count analysis by cause and by country.
4. Death cause trend analysis by country and leading causes.
5. Death cause trend analysis by least impactful causes.
6. Cluster Analysis of death data.
